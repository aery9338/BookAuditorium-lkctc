Hi, My name is Avinav Aery.

This is a client side boilerplate which includes different tools to build the UI efficient and more powerful.

It includes the following:
a) React Redux - (which store the global state, it also includes persist state which store the values in the local storage )
b) Routing - (I also includes the dynamic routing and error handling routes)
c) Error Boundry - (This component is responsible for error handling in the child components)
d) UI Components - (I also includes my own components which is used as React UI library)
e) App Layout - (Fully coustomizable App layout for webapp, which toggle the layout as required)
